## Aggregating NYPD stop-and-frisk dataset

This repo contains simple R code that I used to clean and aggregate the NYPD's 2023 stop-and-frisk dataset by racial groups. This was done as part of my Policy and Data Studio class at NYU.

The file "sqf-2023.csv" contains raw data that I downloaded from the NYPD's website, while the file "stops_by_race_2023.csv" is the cleaned dataset.
